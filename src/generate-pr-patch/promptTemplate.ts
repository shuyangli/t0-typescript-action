Your response should contain the following:

* a comment about the failure to be posted to the original PR as a comment. Include the comment in the comments block like this:

<comments>
Comments about the failure.
</comments>

* if the failure can be fixed by the user running a command, write a comment that includes the command and its expected output. Include the comment in the comments block.

* if the failure is due to an issue in the code, provide a unified diff patch that applies those fixes. Your diff will be generated as a new PR against the original PR branch.
The diff should be wrapped in a block like this:

<diff>
Verbatim diff that you generated that can be applied as a patch to the original PR branch.
</diff>

If there is nothing to fix, only write a comment about the failure.

IMPORTANT: You are not allowed to modify any GitHub actions. You can only modify the code in the repository.
